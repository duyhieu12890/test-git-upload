                    Writing apps for Windows: Selecting a development technology
                </div>
                <div class="main-content">
                    <p>This article contains the information you need to get started building apps for the Windows desktop environment.</p><br>
                    <p>Windows offers a wide range of options for building apps, including C++, .NET, and other emerging technologies such as open source tools on WSL and Rust. With so many choices, it can be difficult to know where to begin.</p>
                    <h2 class="lable-content">IDE</h2>
                    <p>Visual Studio is the go-to development environment for most Windows developers, providing various starting points for different types of apps, each with their own strengths and project types (here's a quick C# tutorial). Every app
                        type includes an app model that defines the app's lifecycle, a default UI framework, and access to a comprehensive set of APIs for using Windows features. Visual Studio Code is another popular tool, with extensions and support
                        for a large number of development languages and tools. For languages other than C# and C++, it's a great place to start.</p>
                    <h2>Languages and frameworks</h2>
                    <p>Many apps for Windows are written using WPF or Windows Forms, and they remain viable tools today. Looking to the future, if your app will only run on Windows we recommend investigating the Windows App SDK and WinUI 3. If you need your
                        app to be cross-platform, consider .NET MAUI, a Progressive Web App (PWA), or React Native for Windows. There are many other options available (here's a list of popular options), but the above are some good starting points.</p>
                    <h2 class="lable-content">Create a WinUI 3 app</h2>
                    <p>The Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3 is the latest user interface (UI) framework for Windows desktop apps, including managed apps that use C# and .NET, and native apps that use C++ with the Win32 API. It is still under very active development,
                        so while it might not be able to meet all your needs today it's maturing with every release. By incorporating the Fluent Design System into all experiences, controls, and styles, WinUI provides consistent, intuitive, and accessible
                        experiences using the latest UI patterns. WinUI 3 is available as part of the Windows App SDK. The Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that can be used in a consistent way by any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app on
                        a broad set of target Windows OS versions.</p>
                    <h2 class="lable-concent">Cross-platform options</h2>
                    <p>WinUI also serves as the basis for cross-platform technologies that provide great native Windows experiences using a variety of coding languages. .NET MAUI and React Native for Windows harness the power of WinUI on Windows, while also
                        enabling execution on other operating systems. Another cross-platform option, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), are websites that function like installed, native apps on Windows and other supported platforms, while functioning like
                        regular websites on browsers.</p>
