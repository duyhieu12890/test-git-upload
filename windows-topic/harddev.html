                    <p>The Windows operating system automatically installs devices without driver packages installed on them when those devices are reported to the operating system as present devices. This happens for all present devices when the system
                        is booting and happens when a user plugs in (or manually installs) a Plug and Play (PnP) device. Drivers such as the ACPI driver and other PnP bus drivers help Windows determine which devices are present.</p>
                    <p>The following steps go over parts of this process in more detail:</p>

                            <p class="item-Hl">Step 1: The New Device is Identified</p>When a bus driver reports a new device to the Windows operating system, Windows needs to query information about this device from the bus driver to identify the device. This information
                            is needed for, among other reasons, to identify the driver package(s) that may apply to this device. The primary information needed from the bus driver in order to choose a driver package to install on the device are the device's
                            hardware identifiers (IDs) and compatible IDs. Windows uses these IDs to find the closest match between a device and a driver package in order to choose a driver package to install on the device. For more information about
                            hardware IDs and compatible IDs, see Device Identification Strings. The format of a hardware ID or compatible ID typically consists of the following: A bus-specific prefix, such as PCI\ or USB\. Vendor-specific identifiers
                            for the device, such as a vendor, model, and revision identifier. The format of these identifiers within the ID is also specific to the bus driver. Compatible IDs are typically more generic than hardware IDs and may not include
                            specific manufacturer or model information and may just represent the kind of device this hardware is. Windows uses hardware IDs and compatible IDs to search for a driver package for the device. It finds a matching driver package
                            for the device by comparing the device's hardware IDs and compatible IDs against those IDs that are specified within the package's INF file. For example, when a user plugs a wireless local area network (WLAN) adapter into the
                            port of a USB hub that is attached to the computer, the following steps occur: The device is detected by the USB hub driver. Based on information that it queries from the adapter, the hub driver creates a hardware ID for the
                            device. For example, the USB hub driver could create a hardware ID of USB\VID_1234&PID_5678&REV_0001 for the WLAN adapter. For more information about the format of USB hardware IDs, see Identifiers for USB Devices. The USB
                            hub driver notifies the Plug and Play (PnP) manager that a new device was detected. The PnP manager queries the hub driver for all of the device's hardware IDs and compatible IDs. The hub driver can create multiple hardware
                            IDs and compatible IDs for the same device. Windows starts a search for a driver package in the Driver Store that matches one of the device's hardware IDs. If Windows cannot find a matching hardware ID, it searches for a driver
                            package that has a matching compatible ID for the device. For more information about this process, see Step 2: A Driver for the Device is Selected.

                            <p class="item-Hl">Step 2: A Driver Package for the Device is Selected</p>After a new device is detected and identified, Windows and its device installation components follow these steps: Windows searches for matching driver package for the device.
                            For more information about this step, see Searching for a Driver Package. Windows selects the most appropriate driver package(s) for the device from one or more driver packages. For more information about this step, see Selecting
                            the Driver. Searching for a Driver Package Using the hardware identifiers (IDs) and compatible IDs that are reported by the bus driver for the device, Windows searches for driver packages that match that device. A driver package
                            matches a device if a hardware ID or compatible ID on the device matches an ID in an INF Models section entry of the driver package's INF file. As an example, on Windows 8 and later, if a user plugs a WLAN adapter into a port
                            of a USB hub, the following steps occur: After the USB hub driver creates a list of hardware IDs and compatible IDs for the WLAN adapter, Windows first searches the Driver Store for a matching driver package for the device.
                            If a driver package is found in the Driver Store, Windows installs it on the device. This allows the device to begin working quickly. In a separate process, Windows searches Windows Update and the DevicePath for a better matching
                            driver than what was installed from the Driver Store. If one is found, the driver is staged into the driver store, and then installed onto the device. For more information about the driver package search process, see Where
                            Windows Searches for Drivers. Note Starting with Windows Vista, the operating system always installs a driver package from the driver store. If a matching driver package is found in another location, Windows first stages the
                            package to the driver store before it installs the driver package on a device. Selecting the Driver As soon as Windows has found one or more matching driver packages for the device, Windows selects the best driver package by
                            following these steps: If Windows has found only one matching driver package, it installs that driver package on the device. If Windows has found multiple matching driver packages, Windows first assigns a ranking value to each
                            match from each driver package. If only one driver has the lowest rank value, it installs that driver package on the device. For more information about the ranking process, see How Windows Ranks Drivers. If multiple driver
                            packages have the same lowest rank value, Windows uses the driver date and version to select the best driver package for the device. The date and version are specified by the INF DriverVer directive that is contained in the
                            driver package's INF file. Once Windows has selected a driver package for the device, Windows installs the driver package as described in Step 3: The Driver for the Device is Installed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <p class="Hl">Step 3: The Driver Package for the Device is Installed</p>After Windows has selected the best driver package for the new device, Windows installs the driver package by following these steps: Based on directives within the driver
                            package's INF file, Windows installs the driver package on the device. For example, it: Copies the driver binaries and other associated files to locations on the hard disk as specified by any relevant INF CopyFiles directive.
                            Performs registry operations as specified by any relevant INF AddReg directive. Assigns a device setup class to the device from the Class and ClassGuid entries in the INF Version section. Once the driver package is installed
                            on the device, the device will be restarted. As part of processing the device again due to the restart, the Plug and Play (PnP) manager identifies the appropriate function driver and any optional filter drivers for the device
                            and attempts to build the device stack and start the device. The PnP manager calls the DriverEntry routine for any required driver that is not yet loaded. The PnP manager then calls the AddDevice routine for each driver, starting
                            with lower-filter drivers, then the function driver, and, finally, any upper filter drivers. The PnP manager assigns resources to the device, if required, and sends an IRP_MN_START_DEVICE to the device's drivers. As soon as
                            this step is complete, the device is installed and ready to be used.
